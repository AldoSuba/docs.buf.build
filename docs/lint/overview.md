Using a [linter][lint] on your Protobuf sources enables you to enforce
consistency and keep your API definitions in line with your chosen best
practices. We recommend enforcing lint [rules](./rules.md) whether you're
working on a small personal project or maintaining a large set of Protobuf
definitions across a major organization, but it's especially important for users
and organizations that continually onboard new engineers who aren't yet
experienced with Protobuf schema design.

The [`buf` CLI][cli] provides linting functionality through the
[`buf lint`](./usage.mdx) command. When you run `buf lint`, `buf` runs a set of
[lint rules](./rules.md) across all of the Protobuf files covered by a
[`buf.yaml`](../configuration/v1/buf-gen-yaml.md) configuration file. By
default, the `buf` CLI uses a curated set of lint rules designed to guarantee
consistency and maintainability across Protobuf schemas of any size and
purpose&mdash;but without being so opinionated that it restricts you from making
the design decisions you need to make for your individual APIs.

Some features of the `buf` CLI's linter:

- **[Selectable configuration](./configuration.md)** of the exact lint rules you
  want, including categorization of lint rules into categories. While we
  recommend using the [`DEFAULT`](./rules.md#default) set of lint rules, you're
  free to go your own way.

- **Editor integration**. The default error output is easily parsed by most
  editors, which allows for a tight feedback loop for lint errors. Currently, we
  provide [Vim and Visual Studio Code integration](../editor-integration.mdx)
  but we may support other editors in the future, such as Emacs and IntelliJ
  IDEs.

- **Speed**. `buf`'s
  [internal Protobuf compiler](../reference/internal-compiler.md) uses all
  available cores to compile your Protobuf schemas while maintaining
  deterministic output. Additionally, it copies files into memory _before_
  processing. As an unscientific example, `buf` can compile all 2,311 `.proto`
  files in [`googleapis`][googleapis] in about 0.8 seconds on a four-core
  machine, while it takes [protoc] 4.3 seconds to do so on the same machine.
  While both are fast, the `buf` CLI provides near-instantaneous feedback, which
  is especially useful for editor integration. `buf`'s speed is directly
  proportional to the input size, so linting a single file only takes a few
  milliseconds.
