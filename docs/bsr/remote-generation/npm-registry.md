:::note

The alpha [JavaScript/TypeScript documentation](../../reference/deprecated/remote-generation/js.md) has moved to the Reference section.

:::

The [Buf Schema Registry](../../bsr/overview.md) (BSR) supports generated SDKs for [JavaScript] and [TypeScript]. With this feature, you can push [Buf modules][modules] to the BSR and install code stubs generated from those modules using dependency management tools like [npm] and [Yarn].

The BSR npm registry makes generated code available like any other dependency, which means:

- Zero tooling to install except for npm (or equivalent)
- No need to keep plugins and supporting library versions in sync
- Dependabot and other tools pick up version changes
- API producers can provide two lines of installation instructions instead of maintaining and publishing an SDK

## Setup

JavaScript and TypeScript source code generated by the BSR is hosted on the **BSR's npm registry** at:

:::note Base URL

buf.build/gen/npm/v1

:::

npm is configured to use the public npm registry at [registry.npmjs.org][npm-registry] by default. To configure npm to use Buf's npm registry, use this command to [set][npm-config] your npm config:

```terminal
$ npm config set @buf:registry https://buf.build/gen/npm/v1
```

This binds the `@buf` package scope to the BSR and updates your global [`.npmrc`][npmrc] accordingly.

You can configure [Yarn] in an analogous way:

```terminal
$ yarn config set @buf:registry https://buf.build/gen/npm/v1
```

### Using private packages {#private}

To install npm packages generated from private [Buf modules][modules], you need to configure npm to send an authentication token with each request to the BSR npm registry.

```terminal
$ npm config set //buf.build/gen/npm/v1/:_authToken {token}
```

This command will add an entry to your [`.npmrc`][npmrc] file:

<Syntax
  title=".npmrc token syntax"
  examples={["//buf.build/gen/npm/v1/:_authToken=84612b6cbe8f4..."]}
  segments={[
    {separator: "//"},
    {label: "buf.build/gen/npm/v1", kind: "constant"},
    {separator: "/:"},
    {label: "_authToken", kind: "constant"},
    {separator: "="},
    {label: "token", kind: "variable"},
  ]}
/>

You can use an existing auth token or generate a new one. To create a new one, log into the [BSR][bsr], navigate to your [user settings][settings] page, and click **Create Token**.

## Available plugins {#plugins}

For a full list of supported plugins navigate to the [BSR plugins page][bsr-plugins] and search for JavaScript/TypeScript.

To learn more about how these plugins are packaged and distributed check out the [bufbuild/plugins repository][bufbuild-plugins]. If you find a useful plugin that should be added please [file an issue][bufbuild-plugins-issue]!

## Installing packages {#install}

With your npm config [set](#setup), you can install `@buf/*` [packages](#package-names) in any standard npm project. Here's an example installation command:

```terminal
$ npm install @buf/bufbuild_eliza.library_connect-web
```

:::info Slow installation?
You may notice that installing packages from the BSR npm registry using `npm install` can take longer than installing from the standard npm registry. This happens because packages are generated "on the fly"&mdash;that is, they're lazily generated and then cached. The first `npm install` typically takes longer than subsequent requests.
:::

## Package names

The BSR npm registry has a special syntax for package names:

<Syntax
  title="Syntax for package names"
  examples={[
    "npm install @buf/bufbuild_eliza.library_connect-web"
  ]}
  segments={[
    {label: "npm install", kind: "constant"},
    {separator: " "},
    {label: "@buf", kind: "constant"},
    {separator: "/"},
    {label: "{moduleOwner}", kind: "constant"},
    {separator: "_"},
    {label: "{moduleName}", kind: "constant"},
    {separator: "."},
    {label: "{pluginOwner}", kind: "constant"},
    {separator: "_"},
    {label: "{pluginName}", kind: "constant"}
  ]
} />

In this example, `@buf/bufbuild_eliza.library_connect-web`, the BSR generates code for the [`bufbuild_eliza`](https://buf.build/bufbuild/eliza) module against the [`library_connect-web`](https://buf.build/library/connect-web) plugin.

## Package versions

By default, when you `npm install` a [Buf module][modules], the BSR generates code from the most recent [reference](../overview.md#referencing-a-module) for the module. But you can also install a specific package version using npm's standard `@` syntax referencing an explicit version or a draft name.

```terminal
$ npm install @buf/bufbuild_eliza.library_connect-web
```

If you do not specify a version, npm will fetch `@latest` by default, which resolves to the package version syntax described below.

```terminal
$ npm install @buf/bufbuild_eliza.library_connect-web@latest
```

Package version syntax is 

import Syntax from "@site/src/components/Syntax";

<Syntax
  title="Package version syntax"
  examples={["0.2.1-20220706172350-dbde79169a01.3"]}
  segments={[
    {label: "pluginVersion", kind: "variable"},
    {separator: "-"},
    {label: "moduleTimestamp", kind: "variable"},
    {separator: "-"},
    {label: "moduleCommit", kind: "variable"},
    {separator: "."},
    {label: "pluginRevision", kind: "variable"}
  ]
} />

With package versions (valid [semver][semver]):

* The version core is the plugin version **0.2.1**
* The semver pre-release version is composed of: 
  * module commit timestamp (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS) **20220706172350**
  * module commit short name (12 characters) **dbde79169a01**
* The final identifier is the plugin revision **3** for the plugin version

Most users will likely use `@latest`, but if you need to reference a package version explicitly you can do so like this:

```terminal
$ npm install @buf/bufbuild_eliza.library_connect-web@0.2.1-20220706172350-dbde79169a01.3
```

### Draft versions

The BSR supports [draft commits][bsr-references]. This feature enables you to push unreleased proto changes and consume generated code without affecting the main branch.

```terminal
$ buf push --draft dev-draft
$ npm install @buf/bufbuild_eliza.library_connect-web@dev-draft
```

The package version for drafts will contain a zero-based timestamp so you can easily differentiate between your main branch versus those that originate from a draft.

```
0.2.1-00000000000000-9bb41b97ede9.3
```

## Other package managers

Because the BSR npm registry implements npm's [public registry API][registry-api], you should be able to use it with package management tools outside of npm, such as [Yarn] and [pnpm], though with [some known limitations](#yarn).

Please be aware that [Yarn] versions greater than [v1.10.0][yarn_v1] and less than [v2][yarn_v2] are _not_ supported. These versions of Yarn require the `shasum` field in the dist object to be set, but the BSR can't compute a digest without generating the code for all possible versions of the package.
