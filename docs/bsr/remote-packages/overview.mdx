title: Overview

Protobuf is a fantastic way to programmatically define your APIs and generate away
a lot of the common work we perform as software engineers to communicate across
our services. Here at Buf, we believe the eventual promise of Protobuf is for
us to stop publishing English-language API specs, and instead move to generated
SDKs that we all consume.

Remote packages is the movement towards this promise. With remote packages,
Buf will take your [modules][modules] and Protobuf plugins, add a little elbow
grease, and generate full-serve packages for you to consume just like any
third-party library in your native programming language. This means you
don't have to worry about Protobuf code generation at all -
you can push [modules][modules] to the BSR and install code stubs generated
from those modules using dependency management tools like [npm](npm.mdx)
and [go](go.mdx).

**Go**

```
# Get the Connect client and server packages for the buf.build/bufbuild/eliza module
$ go get buf.build/gen/go/bufbuild/eliza/bufbuild/connect-go
```

**NPM**

```
# Install the Connect client packages for the buf.build/bufbuild/eliza module
$ npm config set @buf:registry https://buf.build/gen/npm/v1
$ npm install @buf/bufbuild_eliza.bufbuild_connect-web
```

- Zero tooling to install: forget about plugins or Protobuf compilers entirely.
- API producers can provide two lines of installation instructions instead of publishing their own SDKs.
- No need to keep plugins and supporting library versions in sync.
- Dependabot and other tools pick up version changes.
- Any organization-wide caching used for your existing programming languages
  can be used in the exact same way.

## Supported languages

The BSR currently supports Remote Packages for these languages:

import BsrLanguages from "@site/src/components/BsrLanguages";

<BsrLanguages/>

We plan to support Remote Packages for additional languages in the near future, including
(in rough priority order):

- Python
- Java
- Swift
- C#
- Ruby
