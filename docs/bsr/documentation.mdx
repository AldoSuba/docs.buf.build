The BSR comes with complete documentation for your Protobuf files through a
browsable UI with syntax highlighting, one click navigation between definitions
and references. Navigate to a repository within the BSR and click the **Docs**
tab.

For an example see the `bufbuild/eliza` module by visiting
[https://buf.build/bufbuild/eliza](https://buf.build/bufbuild/eliza).

## Module documentation

Most documentation comes directly from comments associated with your Protobuf
definitions. But there also needs to be a way for authors to _describe their
module_ for others to understand its functionality.

To accomplish this, you add a `buf.md` file to the same directory as your
module's `buf.yaml` file and push it to the BSR like normal. Since documentation
is part of your module, any updates to your `buf.md` result in new commits in
the BSR.

The `buf.md` file is analogous to a GitHub repository's `README.md` and
currently supports all of the [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org) syntax.

## Package documentation

The package level documentation provides Protobuf type definitions and comments
for all package files. Clicking through the type definitions takes you to the
referenced item.

You can quickly navigate from the docs to the Protobuf file by clicking the
filename on the right-hand side.

Each type definition has a unique placeholder within the page, an anchor tag,
enabling you to share links to the exact item.

### Package description

When sharing packages it is often useful to provide an overview of the package.
You can do so by adding comments above the `package` directive in your .proto
file.

Comments on the package directive are not merged across files. Files are parsed
alphabetically, and only the first file with a non-empty comment is displayed in
the generated documentation.

### Annotated Protobuf options

The generated documentation renders annotated Protobuf options. A list of options has been selected for rendering at this time. Not all options are included in the generated documentation.

You can find the complete list of Protobuf's built-in options available in the [`descriptor.proto`](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/main/src/google/protobuf/descriptor.proto#L312).

#### List of options rendered in the generated documentation:

**Message Options**
 - `deprecated`

**Field options**
 - `deprecated`
 - `packed`
 - `ctype`
 - `jstype`

**Enum options**
 - `allow_alias`
 - `deprecated`

**EnumValue options**
 - `deprecated`

**Service options**
 - `deprecated`

**Method options**
 - `deprecated`
 - `idempotency_level`

**Note: custom options are not rendered in the generated documentation at this time.**
