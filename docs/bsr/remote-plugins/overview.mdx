One of the greatest challenges with Protobuf code generation is the complexity
of working with `protoc` and [plugins][plugins]. Time and time again, we've
heard that developers want the benefits of code generation, but struggle with
the complex web of different compiler and plugin versions, and the varying
runtime needs that plugins have across different languages. Managing and
maintaining a stable environment locally on a single machine is hard enough, and
the problem is compounded as you scale out code generation across many
developers.

Every organization and open-source project develops homegrown Protobuf tooling
in an effort to simplify the developer experience and maintain consistent output
across developers. A handful of organizations might get a workable solution, but
these remain brittle and difficult to maintain over time. Furthermore, domain
knowledge of these homegrown solutions is lost and upgrade paths become
challenging.

At Buf, we believe code generation is a key building block and the Protobuf
ecosystem deserves a proper solution. With **[remote plugins][plugins]**, you no
longer have to concern yourself with maintaining, downloading, or running
[plugins][plugins] on your local machine. Using a plugin is as simple as
referencing it in your `buf.gen.yaml`:

```yaml
version: v1
plugins:
  # Use protoc-gen-go at v1.28.1
  - plugin: buf.build/protocolbuffers/go:v1.28.1
    out: gen/go
    opt: paths=source_relative
  # Use the latest version of protoc-gen-go-grpc
  - plugin: buf.build/grpc/go
    out: gen/go
    opt: paths=source_relative
```

Just invoke `buf generate` and you're done - no maintaining these plugins, no
worrying about how to download or install them, just generate your stubs and get
back to solving your real problems.

## Publicly-available plugins

Buf verifies and maintains the commonly-used plugins used across the Protobuf
ecosystem.

**To discover the all publicly-available plugins, go to
[buf.build/plugins][plugins].**

This page provides information on all available plugins on the Buf Schema
Registry, including the language type(s) and instructions for use in
[`buf.gen.yaml`](/configuration/v1/buf-gen-yaml). The packaging and distribution
source code for Buf-managed [plugins][plugins] is available
[on GitHub](https://github.com/bufbuild/plugins). If you have a plugin you'd
like us to maintain that you think will be valuable for the community,
[file an issue](https://github.com/bufbuild/plugins/issues/new/choose).

## Private plugins

All public plugins are maintained by Buf for security purposes - we want to make
sure that the code generators everyone uses are verified by us. However,
organizations often write their custom Protobuf plugins to generate logic
specific to their business. For these users, the Buf Schema Registry allows you
to upload your custom, private plugins. This feature is available for
our enterprise users - reach out to us if you'd be interested in working with us!

## Release Candidate Status

Remote plugins should be considered in **Release Candidate** status. We do not
anticipate any breaking changes between now and stability.

We've deprecated the
[remote generation alpha](../../reference/deprecated/remote-generation/overview.mdx),
but it will continue to work until April 30, 2023, at which time you'll need to
migrate to remote plugins or [remote packages](../remote-packages/overview.mdx).
