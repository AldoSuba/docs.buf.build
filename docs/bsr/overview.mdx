## Modules

A **module** is a collection of Protobuf files that are configured, built, and
versioned as a logical unit. By moving away from individual `.proto` files, the
**module** simplifies file discovery and eliminates the need for complex build
scripts to `-I` include, exclude, and configure your Protobuf sources.

Storing modules in the BSR, a Protobuf-aware registry, protects you from
publishing broken builds. Module consumers have confidence that the modules that
they pull compile, something that isn't possible with traditional version
control systems.

The module's name uniquely identifies and gives ownership to a collection of
Protobuf files, which means you can push modules to authorized repositories
within the BSR, add hosted modules as dependencies, consume modules as part of
code generation, and much more.

A **module** is identified by a `name` key in the
[`buf.yaml`](../configuration/v1/buf-yaml.md) file, which is placed at the root
of the Protobuf source files it defines. This tells `buf` where to search for
`.proto` files, and how to handle imports. Unlike `protoc`, where you manually
specify `.proto` files, `buf` recursively discovers all `.proto` files under
configuration to build the module.

```yaml title=buf.yaml {2}
version: v1
name: buf.build/acme/weather
```

The module `name` is composed of three parts: the remote, owner, and repository:



<Syntax
    title="Module name syntax"
    examples={["buf.build/acme/weather"]}
    segments={[
        {label: "buf.build", kind: "default"},
        {separator: "/"},
        {
            label: "owner",
            kind: "variable",
            href: "/bsr/user-management#resource-owner"
        },
        {separator: "/"},
        {label: "repository", kind: "variable", href: "/bsr/overview#modules"}
    ]}
/>

- **Remote**: The DNS name for the server hosting the BSR. This is always
`buf.build`.
- **Owner**: An entity that is either a user or organization within the BSR
ecosystem.
- **Repository**: Stores all versions of a single module

While roughly analogous to Git repositories, a Buf repository is only a remote
location&mdash;there is no concept of a repository "clone" or "fork".
Repositories do not exist in multiple locations.

Every repository is identified by its module name, allowing it to be imported
by other modules and uniquely identified within the BSR.

Many organizations with public Protobuf files are already using the BSR, and
some bigger ones are officially maintained by Buf. These include

- [cncf/xds](https://buf.build/cncf/xds)
- [envoyproxy/envoy](https://buf.build/envoyproxy/envoy)
- [envoyproxy/protoc-gen-validate](https://buf.build/envoyproxy/protoc-gen-validate)
- [gogo/protobuf](https://buf.build/gogo/protobuf)
- [googleapis/googleapis](https://buf.build/googleapis/googleapis)
- [grpc/grpc](https://buf.build/grpc/grpc)
- [opencensus/opencensus](https://buf.build/opencensus/opencensus)
- [opentelemetry/opentelemetry](https://buf.build/opentelemetry/opentelemetry)

## Documentation

Every push to the BSR generates documentation. You may browse the documentation
section of a repository by navigating to the `Docs` tab.

For more information, see [Generated documentation](documentation).

## Dependencies

A module can declare dependencies on other modules, which is configured in the
`deps` key of your `buf.yaml`. You can add dependencies by adding their module
name to the `deps` list. For example:

```yaml title="buf.yaml"
version: v1
name: buf.build/acme/weather
deps:
  - buf.build/acme/units
```

Although we **do not recommend** it, in some situations you may need to pin a
module to a specific version. You can do this by specifying a tag, a commit name,
or a draft name in your `deps` after the `:` delimiter. Ideally, authors keeps
modules backwards-compatible and avoid breaking changes, so you can _always_ rely
on the latest version.

```yaml
deps:
  - buf.build/acme/units:1c473ad9220a49bca9320f4cc690eba5
```

Once a dependency is added to the configuration file, you need to run:

```terminal
$ buf mod update
```

This updates all your deps to their latest version and is captured in a
`buf.lock` file.

**You can now import the Protobuf types just like you would if you had the files
locally:**

```protobuf title="acme/weather/v1/weather.proto" {3,7}
package acme.weather.v1;

import "acme/units/v1/unit.proto";

message Forecast {
  string description = 1;
  acme.units.Degree temperature = 2;
}
```

The `buf` CLI automatically resolves the module(s) specified in the `deps` list.

> See the [Usage](../bsr/usage.mdx#add-a-dependency) section for a detailed
> example.

## Referencing a module

A module has different versions. Each version includes any number of changes,
and each change is identifiable by a unique commit, tag, or draft. The
collective set of module versions is housed within a repository.

**Commit**: Every push of new content to a repository is associated with a
commit that identifies that change in the schema. The commit is created after a
successful push. This means that unlike Git, the commit only exists on the BSR
repository and not locally.

**Tag**: A reference to a single commit but with a human-readable name, similar
to a Git tag. It is useful for identifying commonly referenced
commits&mdash;like a release.

**Draft**: A temporary commit in a development workflow with a human-readable
name, similar to a Git feature branch but without history. It is useful for
iterating on a module while keeping those changes outside the main branch. Can
be overwritten and deleted. When it
is used as a dependency in `buf.yaml` of a module, the module cannot be pushed
until you update to a non-draft commit of the dependency.

## Local modules with workspaces

If you want to depend on local modules, you can set up a
[workspace](../reference/workspaces.mdx) to discover modules through your file
system. If you are in a workspace, `buf` looks for `deps` in your
[workspace configuration](../reference/workspaces.mdx#configuration) _before_
attempting to find it on the BSR.

This makes workspaces a good way to iterate on multiple modules at the same time
before pushing any changes to the BSR.

> [Tour - Use a Workspace](../tour/use-a-workspace.mdx)

## Module cache

`buf` caches files it downloads as part of module resolution in a folder on the
local filesystem to avoid incurring the cost of downloading modules repeatedly.
To choose where to cache the files, it checks these, in order:

- The value of `$BUF_CACHE_DIR`, if set.
- The value of `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` falling back to `$HOME/.cache` on Linux and Mac
and `%LocalAppData%` for Windows.

## Code generation

Hosting modules on the BSR allows anyone with proper access to consume those
modules. This solves the need to coordinate and sync Protobuf files manually
amongst multiple consumers, which is error-prone and leads to drift.

Instead, users generate code from a single source of truth: a hosted module on
the BSR.

In your [`buf.gen.yaml`](../configuration/v1/buf-gen-yaml.md) define plugins and
their respective options, and then generate your code with the `buf` CLI by
referencing a BSR module:

```terminal
$ buf generate buf.build/acme/weather
```

## Remote Plugins

The Buf team packages and distributes plugins to the BSR, browsable at:
[buf.build/plugins][bsr-plugins]

If you're interested in how these plugins are packaged see the
[bufbuild/plugins][bufbuild-plugins] repository for more details.

To learn more about how remote plugins can be used in code generation workflows,
see the [remote plugins'](remote-plugins/usage.mdx) documentation.

## Remote Packages

By combining a BSR module and a plugin you can fetch generated SDKs with your
language's package manager:

**Go Module Proxy**

```terminal
$ go get buf.build/gen/go/bufbuild/eliza/bufbuild/connect-go
```

**NPM Registry**

```terminal
$ npm install @buf/bufbuild_eliza.bufbuild_connect-web@latest
```

For more information, see the [Remote Packages][remote-packages-overview] documentation.

Although beyond the scope of this overview, we suggest taking a look at
[managed mode](../generate/managed-mode.md) as it relates to code generation.
Historically, _consumer concerns_ are conflated with _producer concerns_ due to
hard-coding of language-specific options in Protobuf files, which in turn
restricts their usefulness to consumers. Managed mode addresses existing
limitations and offers a better separation of concerns.
