The Buf Schema Registry (BSR) is a centralized, Protobuf-aware registry that manages and stores Protobuf files as
versioned modules. It offers features such as API validation, versioning, dependency management, documentation, and an
extensible plugin system that simplifies remote code generation. The BSR aims to solve the issues of broken builds, lack
of up-to-date documentation, difficulty in keeping Protobuf files in-sync, and complex client SDK generation. With the
BSR, users can confidently consume and publish APIs, declare, resolve and use hosted BSR modules as dependencies in
their projects, and fetch generated artifacts from managed software repositories.

The BSR's main goals are to provide:

* A Centralized Registry
* Dependency Management
* Discoverable UI & API Documentation
* Remote Plugins & Remote Packages

If you've made it this far, you likely have a good understanding of what the Buf Schema Registry is, its goals,
and the problems it aims to solve in the Protobuf ecosystem. Now it's time to dive deeper and learn about the various
features of the BSR, how to use it, and the concepts that underpin its design. In the reference documentation, you will
find detailed information on how to interact with the BSR, how to publish and consume modules, how to manage
dependencies, and how to generate documentation and SDKs. So if you're ready to take your Protobuf workflow to the next
level, let's continue exploring the Buf Schema Registry!
