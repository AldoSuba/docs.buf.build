title: 10 Generate Go code
---

So far, you've created a new [module](/bsr/explanation#modules), pushed it up
to the [BSR](/bsr/explanation), interacted with generated
[documentation](view-generated-documentation.md), and added a dependency on the
`buf.build/googleapis/googleapis` module. Next, you'll implement the
`PetStoreService` as a Go application and use other powerful Buf features.

Before you continue, move to the `start` directory again. If you're coming from
the [previous step](add-a-dependency), you can run this command:

```terminal
$ cd ..
```

You should also reset the `gen` directory so that you can generate everything
from a clean slate. This is especially relevant since you removed the
`google/type/datetime.proto` definition from the module itself.

```terminal
$ rm -rf gen
```

The `start` directory should now look like this:

```sh
start/
├── buf.gen.yaml
└── petapis
    ├── buf.lock
    ├── buf.md
    ├── buf.yaml
    └── pet
        └── v1
            └── pet.proto
```

## 10.1 Set up Go {#setup}

Install `go` from
[https://golang.org/doc/install](https://golang.org/doc/install). If you don't
have any experience with Go, that's OK! We'll cover everything you need to know
here.

## 10.2 Install plugins {#install-plugins}

You'll use the `protoc-gen-go` and `protoc-gen-go-grpc` plugins to generate code
with `buf generate`, so you'll need to install them:

```terminal
$ go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest
$ go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@latest
```

You also need to update your `PATH` so that `buf` can find the plugins:

```terminal
$ export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```

## 10.3 Edit your `buf.gen.yaml` {#edit-your-bufgenyaml}

Edit the [`buf.gen.yaml`](/configuration/v1/buf-gen-yaml.md) file so that it
configures the `protoc-gen-go` and `protoc-gen-go-grpc` plugins (and their
options):

```diff title="buf.gen.yaml" {3-13}
 version: v1
 plugins:
-  - plugin: cpp
-    out: gen/proto/cpp
-  - plugin: java
-    out: gen/proto/java
+  - plugin: go
+    out: gen/proto/go
+    opt: paths=source_relative
+  - plugin: go-grpc
+    out: gen/proto/go
+    opt: paths=source_relative
```

These edits remove the C++ and Java code generation from a previous step and add
two new code generation outputs:

- The `protoc-gen-go` plugin will generate Go code to the `gen/proto/go`
  directory with the `paths=source_relative` option.
- The `protoc-gen-go-grpc` plugin will generate Go code to the same
  `gen/proto/go` directory with the `paths=source_relative` option.

## 10.4 Generate Go/gRPC client and server stubs {#generate-stubs}

Now that you have a `buf.gen.yaml` with the `protoc-gen-go[-grpc]` plugins
configured, you can generate the code required to implement the
`PetStoreService` API with Go.

Run this command, which targets the version of the module your pushed to the BSR
earlier:

```terminal
$ buf generate buf.build/$BUF_USER/petapis
```

> If a `--template` isn't explicitly specified, the `buf.gen.yaml` found in the
> current directory is used by default.

If successful, you'll notice a few new files in the `gen/proto/go` directory (as
configured by the `buf.gen.yaml` created above):

```sh
start/
├── buf.gen.yaml
├── gen
│   └── proto
│       └── go
│           └── pet
│               └── v1
│                   ├── pet.pb.go
│                   └── pet_grpc.pb.go
└── petapis
    ├── buf.lock
    ├── buf.md
    ├── buf.yaml
    └── pet
        └── v1
            └── pet.proto
```

## 10.5 Generate using remote plugins

Now, you've implemented the `PetStoreService` as a Go application using local
generation. Next, you will do the same with remote plugins.

Before you continue, move to the `start` directory again. If you're coming from
the [previous step](add-a-dependency), you can run this command:

```terminal
$ cd ..
```

You should also reset the `gen` directory so that you can generate everything
remotely from a clean slate.

```terminal
$ rm -rf gen
```

The `start` directory should now look like this:

```sh
start/
├── buf.gen.yaml
└── petapis
    ├── buf.lock
    ├── buf.md
    ├── buf.yaml
    └── pet
        └── v1
            └── pet.proto
```

## 10.6 Edit your `buf.gen.yaml` {#edit-your-bufgenyaml-remote}

Edit the [`buf.gen.yaml`](/configuration/v1/buf-gen-yaml.md) file so that it
configures the
`protoc-gen-go` and `protoc-gen-go-grpc` plugins (and their options):

```diff title="buf.gen.yaml" {3,4,7,8}
 version: v1
 plugins:
-  - plugin: go
+  - plugin: buf.build/protocolbuffers/go:v1.28.1
     out: gen/proto/go
     opt: paths=source_relative
-  - plugin: go-grpc
+  - plugin: buf.build/grpc/go:v1.2.0
     out: gen/proto/go
     opt: paths=source_relative
```

These edits remove the local code generation from a previous step and replace it
with remote plugins for
generation outputs:

* The `protoc-gen-go` plugin will generate Go code to the same directory but the
  action will take place
  at `buf.build/protocolbuffers/go:v1.28.1`
* Similarly, the `protoc-gen-go-grpc` plugin will generate Go code to the same
  directory with
  at `buf.build/grpc/go:v1.2.0`

## 10.7 Generate Go/gRPC client and server stubs {#generate-stubs--remote}

Now that you have a `buf.gen.yaml` with the remote plugins configured, you can
generate the code
required to implement the `PetStoreService` API with Go.

Run this command, which targets the version of the module your pushed to the BSR
earlier:

```terminal
$ buf generate buf.build/$BUF_USER/petapis
```

If successful, you'll notice the files we previously deleted from
the `gen/proto/go` directory (as configured by
the `buf.gen.yaml` created above):

```sh
start/
├── buf.gen.yaml
├── gen
│   └── proto
│       └── go
│           └── pet
│               └── v1
│                   ├── pet.pb.go
│                   └── pet_grpc.pb.go
└── petapis
    ├── buf.lock
    ├── buf.md
    ├── buf.yaml
    └── pet
        └── v1
            └── pet.proto
```
