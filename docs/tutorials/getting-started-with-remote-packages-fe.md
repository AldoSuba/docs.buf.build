Code generation can bring several benefits to client-side development, particularly in terms of integration. Some of the
advantages of code generation for client-side development include:

* Improved Consistency: Code generation can help ensure that the client-side code matches the server-side code, leading to
improved consistency and reduced risk of errors.

* Reduced Boilerplate: Code generation can automate the creation of repetitive or boilerplate code, freeing up time and
resources that can be redirected towards more creative and strategic projects.

* Enhanced Productivity: By using code generation, developers can focus on writing the core logic of their application,
while the generated code takes care of the rest. This can result in a significant increase in productivity.

* Improved Integration: Code generation can improve the integration between the client and server by ensuring that both
sides are using the same data structure and communication protocol. This makes it easier to integrate the different
components of an application, leading to faster and more efficient development.

However, it's important to keep in mind that code generation also has its own set of challenges, such as increased
maintenance overhead and team synchronisation issues. These limitations can be mitigated by using remote packages
instead of generated code.
