Are you ready to take your code generation game to the next level? Look no further! In the next 10 minutes, you will
learn how to use the Buf CLI to easily and efficiently generate code for your project. By following the step-by-step
instructions, you will be able to install and configure the Buf CLI, validate your configuration, and generate code for
your project in no time. With Buf, you'll be able to streamline your code generation process, and say goodbye to manual
code generation tasks. So let's get started and empower your development workflow!

Alright, let's make code generation fun and easy! With this guide, you're about to take a leap into the world of Buf CLI
and learn how to generate code like a pro. And trust me, once you start using Buf, you'll wonder how you ever managed
without it. It may take a bit of time and practice to fully understand and utilize the Buf CLI, but remember, practice
makes perfect! And don't worry, you won't be alone in this journey, this guide will be your trusty companion. So, put on
your learning cap, and let's get started! You'll be generating code like a boss in no time!

We will assume you have already installed `buf` to your $PATH. If you haven't, head on over to
our [installation guide](installation) first.

:::

1. Initialize a new Buf configuration file by running the command `buf init`. This will create a file named `buf.yaml` in
the current directory. This file will be used to specify the configuration for your project.
1. Modify the `buf.yaml` file to specify the configuration for your project. This includes setting the path to your proto
files, specifying the language to generate code for, and configuring any plugins you want to use. The `buf.yaml` file
uses a YAML format, and should be edited with a text editor of your choice.
1. Run the command `buf` check to ensure that your configuration is valid and that all dependencies are met. This command
will validate the configuration and check for any missing dependencies.
1. Run the command `buf lint` to check your proto files for any linting errors. This command checks for style guide
violation and other linting errors in the proto files.
1. To generate code, you will need to run the command `buf generate`, this command will generate the code based on the
configuration specified in `buf.yaml`.

Don't give up now! You're on the right track to mastering the Buf CLI and streamlining your code generation process.
By following this guide, you're about to gain a powerful tool that will make your code generation process faster,
more efficient and reliable. It may take a bit of time and practice to fully understand and utilize the Buf CLI,
but trust me, it's worth it! By sticking with it and working through the steps in this guide, you'll be able to
experience the benefits of using Buf in your workflow. So, don't hesitate, keep moving forward, and remember the
end goal: becoming a code generation master!

1. The generated code will be placed in the directory specified in the `buf.yaml` file under the `out` field. By
default, the code will be generated in a directory named `gen/` in the current directory, but you can specify a
different location by modifying the `out` field in the configuration file.
1. The module process will also create a file named `buf.lock` in the current directory. This file contains
information about the versions of the dependent modules used during code generation. This file is used to ensure
that the code is regenerated only when necessary, and to ensure that the same versions of protos and plugins are used
for all code generation operations.
1. To generate code for a specific language, you can use the with the buf generate command. For example, to
generate code for Java, you would use the command buf generate java.
1. You can also use the buf generate command with a specific protos file or directory, this command will generate the
code only for the specified protos files or directory. For example, to generate code only for example.proto, you
would use the command buf generate path/to/example.proto.

Code generation is like having a personal chef for your development process, especially when it comes to Schema Driven
Development. Just like a chef takes care of preparing your meals, Buf takes care of generating code for you, saving you
time and effort. With Buf, you can say goodbye to the tedious task of manually writing code, and hello to more time for
coding the fun stuff. It's like having a sous chef to help you with the prep work, so you can focus on creating the
gourmet dish. And just like a master chef, Buf allows you to customize and perfect your code generation process, making
it unique to your project's needs. In Schema Driven Development, the Buf CLI acts like a head chef, using your schema as
a recipe to generate the code automatically and consistently. So, fire up your Buf CLI and let it work its magic!

Congratulations on taking the first step towards streamlining your code generation process with Buf CLI! By following
the steps outlined in this guide, you should now be able to install, configure, and use the Buf CLI to generate code
for your project with ease. With Buf, you can save valuable time and effort, allowing you to focus on what really
matters - building amazing things. Whether you're working on a large-scale project or a small one, Buf can help you to
generate code more efficiently. So go ahead, give Buf a try, and see the difference it can make in your workflow.
Remember, with Buf the sky's the limit!
