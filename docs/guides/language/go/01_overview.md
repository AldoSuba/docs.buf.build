Ready to Build a Lightning-Fast Go API? Look No Further Than Buf and Connect!

The following content will guide you on elevating your API building game with Go. With Go, you can effortlessly create
reliable and efficient software. And, as one of the leading players in the Cloud space, it's no surprise that Buf,
Docker, and Kubernetes are all written in Go. You will also learn about gRPC, a high-performance, open-source framework
for building remote procedure call (RPC) APIs, and how it can enhance your API's performance. Finally, you will discover
Connect, a lightweight library for building browser and gRPC-compatible HTTP APIs, and how it streamlines the API
building process by generating type-safe code for you. Join us for a quick 15-minute walkthrough on how to create a
small Connect service in Go and take your API game to the next level.
